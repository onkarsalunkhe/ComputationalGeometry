// Given : a vector valued function in R3, f(t), forsome domain [a,b], and a distance D
// Output : An array of Evaluated function values F such that distance between F[i] and F[i+1] is less than D
// f(t), a, b, D are all upto you to decide. Please choose some interesting values when testing.
// e.g. { f(t) = <0,0,t> on [0,1] for D=1 } is not a terribly interesting problem
